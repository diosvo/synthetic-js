## ⁉️ Tips

- With number problem, consider to use Math operators
- Read the problem carefully to understand constraints and requirements.
- Consider edge cases: empty inputs, single-element arrays, large numbers.
- Think about time and space complexity (Big O notation).
- Choose the right data structure for the job (e.g., Map for frequency counts, Set for uniqueness).
- Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
