## Wrap up

- Represented as an ADJACENCY list (Hash map)

## Elements

### Nodes & Edges

Fully connected graph:

```bash
e = n * (n-1) / 2
```

e.g

```bash
Node/ Verticies: n = 5
Edges: e = 4 (one node can connect to max n-1 nodes)
```

→ Total edges = 10

### 📍 NOTEs

- `n` is the number of nodes.
- `e` in space and time is the number of edges.
