# Two Pointers

Usually used to keep track of array or string <u>indices</u>.

### When to use?

Have to analyze each element of the collection compared to its other elements.

Common patterns in the approach entail:

1. Start from the beginning and the end until they both meet.
2. One moves slow, another moves fast (e.g. cycle in Linked list).
